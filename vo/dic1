Many of the people living in Australia today are descended  from British people. It is now independent from Britain, although it remains a member of the Commonwealth.

The climate is generally warm. Australian culture is popular in Britain. A number of Australian programmes, including soap operas  such as Neighbours  , appear regularly on British television.
