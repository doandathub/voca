Some people may be very offended if you do not.<\/li><\/ul><span class=\"unb\">The human race<\/span><br\/><ul class=\"bullet\"><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">Man<\/span> and <span class=\"eb\">mankind<\/span> have traditionally been used to mean \u2018all men and women\u2019. Many people now prefer to use <span class=\"eb\">humanity<\/span>, <span class=\"eb\">the human race<\/span>, <span class=\"eb\">human beings<\/span> or <span class=\"eb\">people<\/span>.<\/li><\/ul><span class=\"unb\">Jobs<\/span><br\/><ul class=\"bullet\"><li class=\"li\">The suffix <span class=\"eb\">-ess<\/span> in names of occupations such as <span class=\"eb\">actress<\/span>, <span class=\"eb\">hostess<\/span> and <span class=\"eb\">waitress<\/span> shows that the person doing the job is a woman. Many people now avoid these. Instead you can use <span class=\"eb\">actor<\/span> or <span class=\"eb\">host<\/span> (although <span class=\"eb\">actress<\/span> and <span class=\"eb\">hostess<\/span> are still very common), or a neutral word, such as <span class=\"eb\">server<\/span> for <span class=\"ei\">waiter<\/span> and <span class=\"ei\">waitress<\/span>. <\/li><li class=\"li\">Many job names ending in <span class=\"ei\">-man<\/span> also have a female equivalent ending <span class=\"ei\">-woman<\/span> (eg <span class=\"eb\">postman\/postwoman<\/span>), but in some cases one equivalent is rarely or never used, especially in old-fashioned job names that were traditionally done by one sex (eg <span class=\"eb\">coalman<\/span>, <span class=\"eb\">washerwoman<\/span>). Other forms such as <span class=\"eb\">batswoman<\/span> and <span class=\"eb\">tradeswoman<\/span> are becoming more common as more women start to do these jobs.<\/li><li class=\"li\">Neutral words like <span class=\"eb\">assistant<\/span>, <span class=\"eb\">worker<\/span>, <span class=\"eb\">person<\/span> or <span class=\"eb\">officer<\/span> are now often used instead of <span class=\"ei\">-man<\/span> or <span class=\"ei\">-woman<\/span> in the names of jobs. For example, you can use <span class=\"eb\">police officer<\/span> instead of <span class=\"ei\">policeman<\/span> or <span class=\"ei\">policewoman<\/span>, and <span class=\"eb\">spokesperson<\/span> instead of <span class=\"ei\">spokesman<\/span> or <span class=\"ei\">spokeswoman<\/span>. Neutral words are very common in newspapers, on television and radio and in official writing, in both <span class=\"labels\">British English<\/span> and <span class=\"labels\">North American English<\/span>.<\/li><li class=\"li\">When talking about jobs that are traditionally done by the other sex, some people say: <span class=\"eb\">a male secretary<\/span>\/<span class=\"eb\">nurse<\/span>\/<span class=\"eb\">model<\/span> (NOT <span class=\"eb\">man<\/span>) or <span class=\"eb\">a woman<\/span>\/<span class=\"eb\">female<\/span> <span class=\"eb\">doctor<\/span>\/<span class=\"eb\">barrister<\/span>\/<span class=\"eb\">driver<\/span>. However, this is now not usually done unless you need to emphasize which sex the person is, or it is still unusual for the job to be done by a man\/woman: <span class=\"unx\">My daughter prefers to see a woman doctor.<\/span><span class=\"unx\">They have a male nanny for their kids.<\/span><span class=\"unx\">a female racing driver<\/span><\/li><\/ul><span class=\"unb\">Pronouns<\/span><br\/><ul class=\"bullet\"><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">He<\/span> used to be considered to cover both men and women: <span class=\"unx\">Everyone needs to feel he is loved.<\/span> This is not now acceptable. Instead, after <span class=\"eb\">everybody<\/span>, <span class=\"eb\">everyone<\/span>, <span class=\"eb\">anybody<\/span>, <span class=\"eb\">anyone<\/span>, <span class=\"eb\">somebody<\/span>, <span class=\"eb\">someone<\/span>, etc. one of the plural pronouns <span class=\"eb\">they<\/span>, <span class=\"eb\">them<\/span>, and <span class=\"eb\">their<\/span> is often used: <span class=\"unx\">Does everybody know what they want?<\/span><span class=\"unx\">Somebody\u2019s left their coat here.<\/span><span class=\"unx\">I hope nobody\u2019s forgotten to bring their passport with them.<\/span><\/li><li class=\"li\">It is now generally acceptable in writing and speech to use <span class=\"eb\">they<\/span>, <span class=\"eb\">them<\/span>, and <span class=\"eb\">their<\/span> to refer to a singular noun: <span class=\"unx\">When a guest arrives, they check in and we show them to their room.<\/span> However, some people prefer to use <span class=\"eb\">he or she<\/span>, <span class=\"eb\">his or her<\/span>, or <span class=\"eb\">him or her<\/span>: <span class=\"unx\">Everyone knows what\u2019s best for him- or herself.<\/span> <span class=\"eb\">He\/she<\/span> or <span class=\"eb\">(s)he<\/span> can also be used in writing: <span class=\"unx\">If in doubt, ask your doctor. He\/she can give you more information.<\/span> (You may find that some writers just use \u2018she\u2019.) If these uses seem awkward, you can change the sentence and use a plural noun. Instead of saying: <span class=\"unx\">A baby cries when he or she is tired<\/span> you can say <span class=\"unx\">Babies cry when they are tired.<\/span><\/li><li class=\"li\">Some people now specify which pronouns they prefer to be used when they are referred to, usually according to their <a>gender identity<\/a>: <span class=\"unx\">I want to share with you that I am trans, and my pronouns are \u2018they\u2019 and \u2018them\u2019.<\/span><\/li><\/ul><\/span><\/div><div class=\"coll\"><div class=\"box\"><span>Collocations <\/span><\/div><span class=\"body\"><span class=\"unb\">Cinema\/the movies<\/span><br\/><span class=\"unb\">Watching<\/span><br\/><ul class=\"bullet\"><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">go to\/take somebody to (see)<\/span> a film<\/li><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">go to\/sit in<\/span> <span class=\"labels\">(British English)<\/span> the cinema\/<span class=\"labels\">(North American English)<\/span> the (movie) theater<\/li><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">rent<\/span> a film\/DVD<\/li><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">download\/stream<\/span> a film<\/li><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">burn\/copy\/rip<\/span> a DVD<\/li><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">see\/watch<\/span> a film\/DVD\/preview\/trailer<\/li><\/ul><span class=\"unb\">Showing<\/span><br\/><ul class=\"bullet\"><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">show\/screen<\/span> a film<\/li><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">promote\/distribute\/review<\/span> a film<\/li><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"labels\">(British English)<\/span> <span class=\"eb\">be on at<\/span> the cinema<\/li><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">be released on\/come out on\/be out on<\/span> DVD<\/li><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">captivate\/delight\/grip\/thrill<\/span> the audience<\/li><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">do well\/badly <\/span>at the box office<\/li><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">get a lot of\/live up to the<\/span> hype<\/li><\/ul><span class=\"unb\">Film-making<\/span><br\/><ul class=\"bullet\"><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">write\/co-write<\/span> a film\/script\/screenplay<\/li><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">direct\/produce\/make\/shoot\/edit<\/span> a film\/sequel<\/li><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">make<\/span> a romantic comedy\/a thriller\/an action movie<\/li><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">do\/work on<\/span> a sequel\/remake<\/li><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">film\/shoot<\/span> the opening scene\/an action sequence\/footage (of something)<\/li><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">compose\/create\/do\/write<\/span> the soundtrack<\/li><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">cut\/edit (out)<\/span> a scene\/sequence<\/li><\/ul><span class=\"unb\">Acting<\/span><br\/><ul class=\"bullet\"><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">have\/get\/do<\/span> an audition<\/li><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">get\/have\/play<\/span> a leading\/starring\/supporting role<\/li><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">play<\/span> a character\/James Bond\/the bad guy<\/li><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">act in\/appear in\/star in<\/span> a film\/remake<\/li><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">do\/perform\/attempt<\/span> a stunt<\/li><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">work in\/make it big in<\/span> Hollywood<\/li><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">forge\/carve\/make\/pursue<\/span> a career in Hollywood<\/li><\/ul><span class=\"unb\">Describing films<\/span><br\/><ul class=\"bullet\"><li class=\"li\">the camera <span class=\"eb\">pulls back\/pans over something\/zooms in (on something)<\/span><\/li><li class=\"li\">the camera <span class=\"eb\">focuses on something\/lingers on something<\/span><\/li><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">shoot somebody\/show somebody<\/span> in extreme close-up<\/li><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">use<\/span> odd\/unusual camera angles<\/li><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">be filmed\/shot<\/span> on location\/in a studio<\/li><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">be set\/take place<\/span> in London\/in the \u201960s<\/li><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">have<\/span> a happy ending\/plot twist<\/li><\/ul><\/span><\/div> <\/li><\/div>","meanDetailEng":"a woman whose job is operating a camera for making films or television programmes","antonym":"","exampleEng1":"","exampleVN1":"","exampleEng2":"","exampleVN2":"","slug":"camerawoman","type":1,"synonym":"","created_at":null,"updated_at":"2021-10-19T02:34:08.000000Z"}
