Many people now avoid these. Instead you can use <span class=\"eb\">actor<\/span> or <span class=\"eb\">host<\/span> (although <span class=\"eb\">actress<\/span> and <span class=\"eb\">hostess<\/span> are still very common), or a neutral word, such as <span class=\"eb\">server<\/span> for <span class=\"ei\">waiter<\/span> and <span class=\"ei\">waitress<\/span>. <\/li><li class=\"li\">Many job names ending in <span class=\"ei\">-man<\/span> also have a female equivalent ending <span class=\"ei\">-woman<\/span> (eg <span class=\"eb\">postman\/postwoman<\/span>), but in some cases one equivalent is rarely or never used, especially in old-fashioned job names that were traditionally done by one sex (eg <span class=\"eb\">coalman<\/span>, <span class=\"eb\">washerwoman<\/span>). Other forms such as <span class=\"eb\">batswoman<\/span> and <span class=\"eb\">tradeswoman<\/span> are becoming more common as more women start to do these jobs.<\/li><li class=\"li\">Neutral words like <span class=\"eb\">assistant<\/span>, <span class=\"eb\">worker<\/span>, <span class=\"eb\">person<\/span> or <span class=\"eb\">officer<\/span> are now often used instead of <span class=\"ei\">-man<\/span> or <span class=\"ei\">-woman<\/span> in the names of jobs. For example, you can use <span class=\"eb\">police officer<\/span> instead of <span class=\"ei\">policeman<\/span> or <span class=\"ei\">policewoman<\/span>, and <span class=\"eb\">spokesperson<\/span> instead of <span class=\"ei\">spokesman<\/span> or <span class=\"ei\">spokeswoman<\/span>.

However, this is now not usually done unless you need to emphasize which sex the person is, or it is still unusual for the job to be done by a man\/woman: <span class=\"unx\">My daughter prefers to see a woman doctor.<\/span><span class=\"unx\">They have a male nanny for their kids.<\/span><span class=\"unx\">a female racing driver<\/span><\/li><\/ul><span class=\"unb\">Pronouns<\/span><br\/><ul class=\"bullet\"><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">He<\/span> used to be considered to cover both men and women: <span class=\"unx\">Everyone needs to feel he is loved.<\/span> This is not now acceptable.
