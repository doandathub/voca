class=\"eb\">dinner<\/span>, <span class=\"eb\">lunch<\/span>, <span class=\"eb\">supper<\/span> and <span class=\"eb\">tea<\/span> in different ways depending on which English-speaking country they come from. In Britain it may also depend on which part of the country or which social class a person comes from.<\/li><li class=\"li\">A meal eaten in the middle of the day is usually called <span class=\"eb\">lunch<\/span>. If it is the main meal of the day it may also be called <span class=\"eb\">dinner<\/span> in <span class=\"labels\">British English<\/span>, especially in the north of the country and in schools:<ul class=\"eg\"><li><span class=\"unx\">I make sure my kids have a hot school dinner, not just a packed lunch.<\/span><\/li><\/ul><\/li><li class=\"li\">A main meal eaten in the evening is usually called <span class=\"eb\">dinner<\/span>, especially if it is a formal meal. <span class=\"eb\">Supper<\/span> is also an evening meal, but more informal than <span class=\"eb\">dinner<\/span> and usually eaten at home. It can also be a late meal or something to eat and drink before going to bed.<\/li><li class=\"li\">In <span class=\"labels\">British English<\/span>, <span class=\"eb\">tea<\/span> is a light meal in the afternoon with sandwiches, cakes, etc. and a cup of tea:<ul class=\"eg\"><li><span class=\"unx\">a cream tea.<\/span><\/li><\/ul> It can also be a main meal eaten early in the evening, especially by children:<ul class=\"eg\"><li><span class=\"unx\">What time do the kids have their tea?<\/span><\/li><\/ul><\/li><li class=\"li\">As a general rule, if <span class=\"eb\">dinner<\/span> is the word someone uses for the meal in the middle of the day, they probably call the meal in the evening <span class=\"eb\">tea<\/span> or <span class=\"eb\">supper<\/span>.
