Stative verbs are not usually used in the progressive tenses. However, it is becoming more common for some stative verbs to be used with progressive tenses. Stative verbs such as <span class=\"eb\">want<\/span>, <span class=\"eb\">like<\/span>, <span class=\"eb\">love<\/span>, <span class=\"eb\">hate<\/span> and <span class=\"eb\">think<\/span> are sometimes used in informal language to describe a state at a particular moment, or a state that continues for a period of time:<ul class=\"eg\"><li><span class=\"unx\">Why are you wanting a new phone when your current one works perfectly well?<\/span><\/li><li><span class=\"unx\">What shall we do tonight?
