Some people may be very offended if you do not.<\/li><\/ul><span class=\"unb\">The human race<\/span><br\/><ul class=\"bullet\"><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">Man<\/span> and <span class=\"eb\">mankind<\/span> have traditionally been used to mean \u2018all men and women\u2019. Many people now prefer to use <span class=\"eb\">humanity<\/span>, <span class=\"eb\">the human race<\/span>, <span class=\"eb\">human beings<\/span> or <span class=\"eb\">people<\/span>.<\/li><\/ul><span class=\"unb\">Jobs<\/span><br\/><ul class=\"bullet\"><li class=\"li\">The suffix <span class=\"eb\">-ess<\/span> in names of occupations such as <span class=\"eb\">actress<\/span>, <span class=\"eb\">hostess<\/span> and <span class=\"eb\">waitress<\/span> shows that the person doing the job is a woman. Many people now avoid these. Instead you can use <span class=\"eb\">actor<\/span> or <span class=\"eb\">host<\/span> (although <span class=\"eb\">actress<\/span> and <span class=\"eb\">hostess<\/span> are still very common), or a neutral word, such as <span class=\"eb\">server<\/span> for <span class=\"ei\">waiter<\/span> and <span class=\"ei\">waitress<\/span>. <\/li><li class=\"li\">Many job names ending in <span class=\"ei\">-man<\/span> also have a female equivalent ending <span class=\"ei\">-woman<\/span> (eg <span class=\"eb\">postman\/postwoman<\/span>), but in some cases one equivalent is rarely or never used, especially in old-fashioned job names that were traditionally done by one sex (eg <span class=\"eb\">coalman<\/span>, <span class=\"eb\">washerwoman<\/span>). Other forms such as <span class=\"eb\">batswoman<\/span> and <span class=\"eb\">tradeswoman<\/span> are becoming more common as more women start to do these jobs.<\/li><li class=\"li\">Neutral words like <span class=\"eb\">assistant<\/span>, <span class=\"eb\">worker<\/span>, <span class=\"eb\">person<\/span> or <span class=\"eb\">officer<\/span> are now often used instead of <span class=\"ei\">-man<\/span> or <span class=\"ei\">-woman<\/span> in the names of jobs. For example, you can use <span class=\"eb\">police officer<\/span> instead of <span class=\"ei\">policeman<\/span> or <span class=\"ei\">policewoman<\/span>, and <span class=\"eb\">spokesperson<\/span> instead of <span class=\"ei\">spokesman<\/span> or <span class=\"ei\">spokeswoman<\/span>. Neutral words are very common in newspapers, on television and radio and in official writing, in both <span class=\"labels\">British English<\/span> and <span class=\"labels\">North American English<\/span>.<\/li><li class=\"li\">When talking about jobs that are traditionally done by the other sex, some people say: <span class=\"eb\">a male secretary<\/span>\/<span class=\"eb\">nurse<\/span>\/<span class=\"eb\">model<\/span> (NOT <span class=\"eb\">man<\/span>) or <span class=\"eb\">a woman<\/span>\/<span class=\"eb\">female<\/span> <span class=\"eb\">doctor<\/span>\/<span class=\"eb\">barrister<\/span>\/<span class=\"eb\">driver<\/span>. However, this is now not usually done unless you need to emphasize which sex the person is, or it is still unusual for the job to be done by a man\/woman: <span class=\"unx\">My daughter prefers to see a woman doctor.<\/span><span class=\"unx\">They have a male nanny for their kids.<\/span><span class=\"unx\">a female racing driver<\/span><\/li><\/ul><span class=\"unb\">Pronouns<\/span><br\/><ul class=\"bullet\"><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">He<\/span> used to be considered to cover both men and women: <span class=\"unx\">Everyone needs to feel he is loved.<\/span> This is not now acceptable.

He\/she can give you more information.<\/span> (You may find that some writers just use \u2018she\u2019.) If these uses seem awkward, you can change the sentence and use a plural noun. Instead of saying: <span class=\"unx\">A baby cries when he or she is tired<\/span> you can say <span class=\"unx\">Babies cry when they are tired.<\/span><\/li><li class=\"li\">Some people now specify which pronouns they prefer to be used when they are referred to, usually according to their <a>gender identity<\/a>: <span class=\"unx\">I want to share with you that I am trans, and my pronouns are \u2018they\u2019 and \u2018them\u2019.<\/span><\/li><\/ul><\/span><\/div> <\/li><\/div>","meanDetailEng":"used as the object of a verb, after the verb be  or after a preposition to refer to a woman or girl who has already been mentioned or is easily identified","antonym":"adhere,adherence,all-weather,altogether,altogetherness","exampleEng1":"Meg loves her job.","exampleVN1":"Meg y\u00eau c\u00f4ng vi\u1ec7c c\u1ee7a m\u00ecnh.","exampleEng2":"She broke her leg skiing.","exampleVN2":"C\u00f4 g\u00e3y ch\u00e2n tr\u01b0\u1ee3t tuy\u1ebft.","slug":"her","type":2,"synonym":"hair,hairy,hare,harry,hear,hearer,heir,her,here,hero","created_at":null,"updated_at":"2021-10-22T07:17:21.000000Z"}
